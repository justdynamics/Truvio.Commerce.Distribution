# Changelog — base/2.3

## 2.3.2

B2B-default pass: the base layer now presents a business-buyer storefront out of
the box, gate-proven on Swift 2.3. What a consumer sees change from 2.3.1:

- **Anonymous pricing hidden.** Prices are hidden for anonymous visitors on the
  product list and detail pages; a sign-in nudge replaces them. Signed-in buyers
  see prices. (B1)
- **Single, neutrally-named shop.** The nine demo shops collapse to one —
  "B2B Commerce Store" (formerly "Bikes"). The eight extra shops
  (Product category, Partner, Brands, Additionals, Digital Assets Portal,
  Channel-Amazon, Printing catalogs, EU Packaging) and their shop/group and
  shop/language relation rows are removed. Bind the site root + shop after
  deserialize, then restart (see the base contract). (B5)
- **List-mode product listing.** The product list page defaults to list view with
  B2B-fit columns; the grid toggle stays available. Standard Swift building
  blocks only — no custom templates or code. (B4)
- **"Home Machines" page removed.** The demo Home Machines page is gone from both
  the English and Dutch content areas, with its navigation and merge-manifest
  entries pruned. (B2)
- **Digital Assets Portal header decoupled.** The Swift storefront header no
  longer carries a link to the Digital Assets Portal (desktop, English + Dutch);
  the reciprocal storefront back-link is removed from the `dap-portal` layer. (B3)
- **Customer Center Overview is a tile dashboard.** Signing in lands the buyer on
  a function-tile dashboard (Orders, Quotes, Carts, Favorites, Addresses,
  Profile, Returns) instead of an order list — each tile routes to its function
  page. English + Dutch. (B6)
- **CSR dashboard + page-level gating.** A separate CSR dashboard ships, with
  Customer Center pages gated by role (CSR vs. buyer) at the page level. (B7)
- **Returns (RMA) in the Customer Center.** A "My returns" / "Mijn retouren" page
  wired to the stock Swift returns components is added to the customer tree and
  the tile dashboard, English + Dutch. (B9)
- **Per-environment exclusions documented.** `base.contract.json` now enumerates
  the deliberately non-serialized per-environment Area columns (domain,
  frontpage, shop, country, language, currency, stock location) and the consumer
  obligation to bind site root + shop after deserialize and restart. (B10)

Editions that build on the base (`swift-demo`, `headless-demo`, `base-only`,
`dap-portal`) re-pin to `base@2.3.2`.

Known issues deliberately shipped (deferred, tracked): a few historical item
Titles carry bike-era text from an engine link-resolution defect fixed upstream
(no new occurrences), and the Dutch Customer Center subtree is not yet gated for
anonymous visitors (the English subtree is). Both are queued for a follow-up
pass.
